What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge creates a new commit that merges two branches, then adds the most recent commit to the target branch. A rebase
creates a new commit for each change in the source branch, then applies the commits to the target branch one at a time.

What is a remote repository? 

A remote repository is a version control system used to keep a record of all changes made to a
project regardless of how many people are working on it at the same time.
